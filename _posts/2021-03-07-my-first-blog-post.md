# Just got my Samsung Galaxy Flex Alpha

## My plan for this machine is to have it configurated for ease of use with

- Git
- GitHub
- Git-Towers
- GitKraken
- Gitpod
- VScode
- Windows Terminal

### really put to use the GitHub Student Dev Pack by learning all the in-and-out the dev pack provides

all at the same time to better my skills
